Programming Assignment 2 - Lexical Scoping

The assignment is to create a pair of functions that calculate the inverse of a matrix

## Part 1 - makeCacheMatrix
This function creates a special ***matrix*** object that can cache its inverse

## Part 2 - cacheSolve
This function computes the inverse of the special ***matrix*** returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

**NOTE:** The ***matrix*** is always assumed to be invertible
